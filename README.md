# Neutron
Cinema 4D Neutron Assets
A playground to test out the use of GitHub for Cinema 4D Neutron Node assets.
All assets that can be found here are only for testing purposes, they are not meant for production use, any use of them is at your own risk.
This repository requires you to use Cinema 4D R25 v25.010, other versions might work but are not supported.

To use the Assets within the databes, i.e. Playground, you should pull the folder and point to it as a database folder from the Cinema 4D Preferences.
After every pull make sure to either 
* Reload Databases (Asset Browser->Edit->Reload Databases) 
* restart Cinema 4D
* toggle the enable checkmark in front of the database in the preferences off and on again
